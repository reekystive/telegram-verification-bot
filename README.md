# Telegram Verification Bot

A customizable verification bot designed for Telegram groups.

This bot helps maintain the integrity of large public groups by
verifying new members through a series of user-defined questions.
New members must answer the questions correctly to gain access to
the group; those who fail to do so are automatically banned.
The bot is easy to set up and provides flexible options for creating
and managing verification questions and answers.

## Quick Start Development

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
